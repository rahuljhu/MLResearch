    "to leave his wife, to leave his babes, His mansion, and his titles, in a place From whence himself does fly.",
    "He loves us not: He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren, The most diminutive of birds, will fight, Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.",
    "All is the fear, and nothing is the love; As little is the wisdom, where the flight So runs against all reason.",

    "With this there grows In my most ill-composd affection such A staunchless avarice, that, were I king, I should cut off the nobles for their lands; Desire his jewels, and this others house: And my more-having would be as a sauce To make me hunger more; that I should forge Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal, Destroying them for wealth.",
    "This avarice Sticks deeper; grows with more pernicious root Than summer-seeming lust; and it hath been The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear; Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will, Of your mere own.",
    "But I have none: the king-becoming graces, As justice, verity, temprance, stableness, Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness, Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude, I have no relish of them; but abound In the division of each several crime, Acting it many ways.",

    "Now is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland Would create soldiers, make our women fight, To doff their dire distresses.",
    "Gracious England hath Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men; An older and a better soldier none That Christendom gives out.",
    "Would I could answer This comfort with the like. But I have words That would be howld out in the desert air, Where hearing should not latch them.",
    "or is it a fee-grief Due to some single breast. No mind thats honest But in it shares some woe, though the main part Pertains to you alone.",
    "Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever, Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound That ever yet they heard.",
    "To relate the manner Were, on the quarry of these murderd deer, To add the death of you. neer pull your hat upon your brows.",
    "The grief that does not speak Whispers the oer-fraught heart, and bids it break. Wife, children, servants, all That could be found.",
    "And I must be from thence. Be comforted: Lets make us medcines of our great revenge, To cure this deadly grief.",
    "I shall do so; But I must also feel it as a man: I cannot but remember such things were, That were most precious to me.",
    "Naught that I am, Not for their own demerits, but for mine, Fell slaughter on their souls: heaven rest them now. Be this the whetstone of your sword.",
    "Let grief Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it. O, I could play the woman with mine eyes, And braggart with my tongue.",
    "But, gentle heavens, Cut short all intermission; front to front, Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself; Within my swords length set him; if he scape, Heaven forgive him too.",
    "This tune goes manly. Come, go we to the King. Our power is ready; Our lack is nothing but our leave.",
    "Macbeth Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may; The night is long that never finds the day.",
    "A Room in the Castle. Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman. I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your report.",
    "Since his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upont, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.",
    "In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say.",
    "Neither to you nor anyone; having no witness to confirm my speech. Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper. Lo you, here she comes.",
    "This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close. How came she by that light.",
    "Why, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; tis her command. You see, her eyes are open. Ay, but their sense are shut. What is it she does now.",
    "Look how she rubs her hands. It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.",
    "I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly. Why, then tis time to dot. a soldier, and afeard.",
    "What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account. Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him.",
    "The Thane of Fife had a wife. What, will these hands neer be clean. No more o that, my lord, no more o that: you mar all with this starting.",
    "You have known what you should not. She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that: heaven knows what she has known.",
    "Heres the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. What a sigh is there. The heart is sorely charged.",
    "This disease is beyond my practice: yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep, who have died holily in their beds.",
    "Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquos buried; he cannot come out ons grave. Theres knocking at the gate.",
    "Come, come, come, come, give me your hand. Whats done cannot be undone. Will she go now to bed. Foul whisprings are abroad.",
    "Look after her; Remove from her the means of all annoyance, And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night: My mind she has mated, and amazd my sight.",
    "Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man. Near Birnam wood Shall we well meet them.",
    "I have a file Of all the gentry: there is Siwards son And many unrough youths, that even now Protest their first of manhood. What does the tyrant.",
    "Some say hes mad; others, that lesser hate him, Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain, He cannot buckle his distemperd cause Within the belt of rule.",
    "Now does he feel His secret murders sticking on his hands; Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach; Those he commands move only in command, Nothing in love: now does he feel his title Hang loose about him, like a giants robe Upon a dwarfish thief.",
    "Who, then, shall blame His pesterd senses to recoil and start, When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there.",
    "Well, march we on, To give obedience where tis truly owd: Meet we the medcine of the sickly weal; And with him pour we, in our countrys purge, Each drop of us.",
    "Or so much as it needs To dew the sovereign flower, and drown the weeds. Make we our march towards Birnam. A Room in the Castle.",
    "Enter Macbeth, Doctor and Attendants. Bring me no more reports; let them fly all: Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane I cannot taint with fear.",
    "The spirits that know All mortal consequences have pronouncd me thus: Fear not, Macbeth; no man thats born of woman Shall eer have power upon thee.",
    "Then fly, false thanes, And mingle with the English epicures: The mind I sway by, and the heart I bear, Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.",
    "Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear, Thou lily-liverd boy. What soldiers, patch. those linen cheeks of thine Are counsellors to fear.",
    "What soldiers, whey-face. The English force, so please you. I am sick at heart, When I beholdSeyton, I say. This push Will cheer me ever or disseat me now.",
    "I have livd long enough: my way of life Is falln into the sere, the yellow leaf; And that which should accompany old age, As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends, I must not look to have; but, in their stead, Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath, Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.",
    "Whats your gracious pleasure. All is confirmd, my lord, which was reported. Ill fight till from my bones my flesh be hackd.",
    "Cure her of that: Canst thou not minister to a mind diseasd, Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow, Raze out the written troubles of the brain, And with some sweet oblivious antidote Cleanse the stuffd bosom of that perilous stuff Which weighs upon the heart.",
    "Therein the patient Must minister to himself. Throw physic to the dogs, Ill none of it. Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff: Seyton, send out.",
    "If thou couldst, doctor, cast The water of my land, find her disease, And purge it to a sound and pristine health, I would applaud thee to the very echo, That should applaud again.",
    "Were I from Dunsinane away and clear, Profit again should hardly draw me here. Country near Dunsinane: a Wood in view.",
    "Enter, with drum and colours Malcolm, old Siward and his Son, Macduff, Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox, Ross and Soldiers, marching.",
    "Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe. What wood is this before us.",
    "Let every soldier hew him down a bough, And beart before him. Thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host, and make discovery Err in report of us.",
    "Tis his main hope; For where there is advantage to be given, Both more and less have given him the revolt, And none serve with him but constrained things, Whose hearts are absent too.",
    "The time approaches, That will with due decision make us know What we shall say we have, and what we owe.",
    "Enter with drum and colours, Macbeth, Seyton and Soldiers. Hang out our banners on the outward walls; The cry is still, They come.",
    "Our castles strength Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up.",
    "Were they not forcd with those that should be ours, We might have met them dareful, beard to beard, And beat them backward home. [_A cry of women within.",
    "_] What is that noise. It is the cry of women, my good lord. I have almost forgot the taste of fears.",
    "The time has been, my senses would have coold To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir As life were int.",
    "I have suppd full with horrors; Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts, Cannot once start me. Wherefore was that cry. The Queen, my lord, is dead.",
    "Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time; And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death.",
    "Lifes but a walking shadow; a poor player, That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more: it is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.",
    "Thou comst to use thy tongue; thy story quickly. Gracious my lord, I should report that which I say I saw, But know not how to dot.",
    "As I did stand my watch upon the hill, I lookd toward Birnam, and anon, methought, The wood began to move. Let me endure your wrath, ift be not so.",
    "If thou speakst false, Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive, Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth, I care not if thou dost for me as much.",
    "I gin to be aweary of the sun, And wish th estate o th world were now undone. Ring the alarum bell. At least well die with harness on our back.",
    "You, worthy uncle, Shall with my cousin, your right noble son, Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we Shall take upons what else remains to do, According to our order.",
    "Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath, Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death. Another part of the Plain. They have tied me to a stake.",
    "I cannot fly, But, bear-like I must fight the course. Whats he That was not born of woman. Such a one Am I to fear, or none. Thoult be afraid to hear it.",
    "No; though thou callst thyself a hotter name Than any is in hell. The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear.",
    "No, nor more fearful. Thou liest, abhorred tyrant. With my sword Ill prove the lie thou speakst. [_They fight, and young Siward is slain.",
    "Thou wast born of woman. But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, Brandishd by man thats of a woman born. That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face.",
    "There thou shouldst be; By this great clatter, one of greatest note Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune. _] Enter Malcolm and old Siward.",
    "This way, my lord;the castles gently renderd: The tyrants people on both sides do fight; The noble thanes do bravely in the war, The day almost itself professes yours, And little is to do.",
    "We have met with foes That strike beside us. Enter, sir, the castle. Another part of the field. Why should I play the Roman fool, and die On mine own sword.",
    "Of all men else I have avoided thee: But get thee back; my soul is too much chargd With blood of thine already.",
    "Thou losest labour: As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air With thy keen sword impress, as make me bleed: Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests; I bear a charmed life, which must not yield To one of woman born.",
    "Despair thy charm; And let the angel whom thou still hast servd Tell thee, Macduff was from his mothers womb Untimely rippd.",
    "And be these juggling fiends no more believd, That palter with us in a double sense; That keep the word of promise to our ear, And break it to our hope.",
    "Ill not fight with thee. Then yield thee, coward, And live to be the show and gaze o th time.",
    "Well have thee, as our rarer monsters are, Painted upon a pole, and underwrit, Here may you see the tyrant.",
    "I will not yield, To kiss the ground before young Malcolms feet, And to be baited with the rabbles curse.",
    "Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane, And thou opposd, being of no woman born, Yet I will try the last.",
    "Before my body I throw my warlike shield: lay on, Macduff; And damnd be him that first cries, Hold, enough.",
    "Enter, with drum and colours, Malcolm, old Siward, Ross, Thanes and Soldiers. I would the friends we miss were safe arrivd.",
    "Some must go off; and yet, by these I see, So great a day as this is cheaply bought. Macduff is missing, and your noble son.",
    "Your son, my lord, has paid a soldiers debt: He only livd but till he was a man; The which no sooner had his prowess confirmd In the unshrinking station where he fought, But like a man he died.",
    "Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow Must not be measurd by his worth, for then It hath no end. Had he his hurts before.",
    "Why then, Gods soldier be he. Had I as many sons as I have hairs, I would not wish them to a fairer death: And so his knell is knolld.",
    "Hes worth more sorrow, And that Ill spend for him. They say he parted well and paid his score: And so, God be with him. Here comes newer comfort.",
    "Enter Macduff with Macbeths head. Hail, King, for so thou art. Behold, where stands Th usurpers cursed head: the time is free.",
    "I see thee compassd with thy kingdoms pearl, That speak my salutation in their minds; Whose voices I desire aloud with mine, Hail, King of Scotland.",
    "Hail, King of Scotland. We shall not spend a large expense of time Before we reckon with your several loves, And make us even with you.",
    "Whats more to do, Which would be planted newly with the time, As calling home our exild friends abroad, That fled the snares of watchful tyranny; Producing forth the cruel ministers Of this dead butcher, and his fiend-like queen, Who, as tis thought, by self and violent hands Took off her life;this, and what needful else That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace, We will perform in measure, time, and place."
